# goheels-scrape
Scraper for UNC Soccer team's data

Pyscrape.py does all the scraping and writes to a json file
  players.json key:value pairs are player_num:player_data
  
The python notebook imports pyscrape.py as a moduele so that user doesn't need to run the script in terminal.
The notebook also uses the pandas library to render the data in an easy to see format.
